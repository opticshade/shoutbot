# shoutbot

This was going to be a shoutbot but I got distracted and made it a dice roller
for nWoD (New World of Darkness) instead. It handles explosing dice 8/9 again
and rote actions.

# Install

install deno check out the source create a .env file with your DISCORD_TOKEN for
your bot then run deno run -A mod.ts

# Misc

This was just a side project to learn a bit of TypeScript and Deno. I haven't
even done JS in years so its probably not the best. But feel free to use it for
your nWod games!
